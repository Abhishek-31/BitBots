# Shopedia Website

## Problem
After the rise of e-commerce websites like FlipKart and Amazon, a lot of small shops have run out of business.
Books, clothes, laptops are all bought online. 
Our website isn't a corporation, but it's a platform for small shop owners and users to interact.

## Technology Used
We've used Node.js, MongoDB and Front-End languages

We have also used the ZulipChat API to spread our project's reach. Through a chat bot, the entire user model of the project can be accessed through saying, "Where can I find ...something?"
And it'll suggest you a shop which is nearby!

## Credits
This is the the project made by Team BitBots.

# BitBots

After the rise of e-commerce websites like FlipKart and Amazon, a lot of small shops have run out of business. Books, clothes, laptops are all bought online. Our website, Shopedia, isn't a corporation, but it's a platform for small shop owners and users to interact.

Shopedia has two components: the Website and the server, and the **Zulip Bot**

## Zulip Bot
The ZulipChat Bot is a personalised bot that can point to the nearest shop presently selling the item you want to shop!
NOTE: The shop which will be out of stock will also not be shown.

## Website
Please refer to the Website READMe to know more about it
